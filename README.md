Just a Discord bot built for fun.

## Development

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `cp .env.example .env`
4. (Fill in your environment variables)
5. `node index.js`

Note there's no file watching, so you need to restart the server whenever you make changes. Also if multiple people are running the same discord token idk what happens it'll probably error out.
